        'Mental': [
                "🧠 **Pause Before You React:** When anger rises, give yourself a few seconds of silence before responding. This brief pause activates your brain’s reasoning center and prevents impulsive reactions.",
    
                "🧠 **Identify the True Source:** Anger often masks deeper emotions like hurt or fear. Ask yourself, ‘What am I really feeling underneath this anger?’ Recognizing the root emotion promotes understanding and control.",
    
                "🧠 **Reframe the Situation:** Instead of focusing on the offense, shift perspective — ‘What can I learn or change in this moment?’ Reframing helps turn confrontation into growth.",
    
                "🧠 **Use “I” Statements:** Express your feelings without blame. Say, ‘I feel upset when…’ instead of ‘You always…’. This encourages communication over conflict and preserves relationships.",
    
                "🧠 **Reflect After Cooling Down:** Once calm, take time to evaluate what triggered you and what you might do differently next time. Reflection turns anger into emotional intelligence."

            "🚶 **Channel Energy Through Movement:** Go for a brisk walk, do light exercise, or stretch your arms and neck. Physical release helps burn off the adrenaline that fuels anger.",
    
            "💧 **Use Cooling Techniques:** Splash cool water on your face or hold something cold. Cooling the body physiologically lowers emotional intensity and restores calm.",
    
            "🧍 **Body Awareness Reset:** Notice where you feel anger — in your fists, chest, or jaw. Relax those muscles and drop your shoulders. This tells your nervous system that the threat has passed.",
    
            "😌 **Ground Yourself Physically:** Feel your feet on the floor, notice your breath, and orient your eyes to the present space. Grounding pulls the mind away from reactive thought loops."

        'Spiritual': [
             "🙏 **Pray for Calm and Understanding:** In moments of anger, ask God to quiet your spirit and grant wisdom before you speak. *'My dear brothers and sisters, be quick to listen, slow to speak, and slow to become angry.' — James 1:19*",
    
            "📖 **Meditate on Scriptures of Patience:** Reflect on verses that guide you toward gentleness and peace. *'A gentle answer turns away wrath, but a harsh word stirs up anger.' — Proverbs 15:1*",
    
            "🌿 **Surrender the Situation to God:** Release the desire for control or revenge through prayer. *'Do not repay anyone evil for evil... If it is possible, as far as it depends on you, live at peace with everyone.' — Romans 12:17-18*",
    
            "💬 **Speak Blessing Instead of Bitterness:** When tempted to speak harshly, choose words that heal. *'Let all bitterness and wrath and anger and clamor and slander be put away from you... Be kind to one another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another, as God in Christ forgave you.' — Ephesians 4:31-32*",
    
            "🌅 **Reflect on God’s Patience Toward You:** Remember that God is slow to anger and rich in mercy — modeling the same grace brings peace to your heart. *'The Lord is compassionate and gracious, slow to anger, abounding in love.' — Psalm 103:8*"

            "🧠 **Identify the Need:** Ask yourself, 'What am I truly missing or needing right now?'"
            "🧠 **Acknowledge and Name the Sadness:** Rather than pushing it away, gently label what you feel — ‘I’m sad right now.’ Naming the emotion helps your brain process it instead of being overwhelmed by it.",
    
            "🧠 **Challenge Hopeless Thoughts:** When sadness whispers that ‘nothing will change,’ question that belief. Ask yourself, ‘What evidence do I have that this feeling will last forever?’ This thought reappraisal brings balance and perspective.",
    
            "🧠 **Engage in Self-Compassion Talk:** Speak to yourself as you would to a close friend — with kindness, not criticism. Self-compassion activates emotional healing and reduces mental rumination.",
    
            "🧠 **Focus on Small Restorative Actions:** When sadness drains motivation, identify one simple step — like opening a window, journaling, or taking a short walk. Small actions reintroduce control and forward movement.",
    
            "🧠 **Reframe Loss or Disappointment:** Ask, ‘What might this experience be teaching me?’ Shifting from pain to purpose helps the mind find meaning beyond the sadness."
        ],
        'Physical': [
            "💪 **Comfort & Care:** Seek warmth (blanket, tea). Ensure adequate hydration and rest, as your body is working hard to process the emotion."
            "💧 **Allow the Body to Feel:** Sadness often shows up physically — heaviness in the chest or fatigue. Notice these sensations without judgment and breathe gently through them. Allowing the body to express emotion promotes release.",
    
            "🚶 **Gentle Movement:** Engage in mild physical activity — a short walk, stretching, or slow dancing. Movement increases endorphins, the body’s natural mood stabilizers.",
    
            "😴 **Prioritize Rest and Nutrition:** Sadness can disrupt sleep and appetite. Maintain a routine with balanced meals and adequate rest to support emotional recovery.",
    
            "🌞 **Seek Natural Light:** Exposure to sunlight helps regulate serotonin and melatonin levels, improving both energy and mood. Even a few minutes outdoors can lift the spirit.",

            "📖 **Reflect on God’s Faithfulness:** When sadness feels heavy, meditate on times God has carried you before. *'He heals the brokenhearted and binds up their wounds.' — Psalm 147:3*",
    
            "🌅 **Rest in God’s Presence:** Take a few quiet minutes to sit in stillness, breathing slowly as you imagine being held in God’s peace. *'Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest.' — Matthew 11:28*",
    
            "💬 **Speak Words of Hope:** Say aloud verses that remind you of God’s promises. Hearing your own voice affirm truth can restore courage. *'Weeping may last through the night, but joy comes with the morning.' — Psalm 30:5*",
    
            "🌿 **Practice Gratitude in Faith:** Even in sadness, name small things you are thankful for — a friend, a moment of light, or breath itself. Gratitude reorients the heart toward hope. *'Give thanks in all circumstances; for this is God’s will for you in Christ Jesus.' — 1 Thessalonians 5:18*"

        'color': "#7F00FF", 
        'Mental': [
            "🧠 **Fact-Checking:** Differentiate between the actual threat and the catastrophic story your mind is telling you.",
            "🧠 **Focus on NOW:** Bring your attention back to the present moment, away from future worries."
            "🧠 **Pause and Acknowledge the Fear:** When fear arises, don’t rush to suppress it. Instead, take a brief mental pause and simply name what you’re feeling — ‘I’m afraid right now.’ This act of acknowledgment reduces the brain’s alarm response and begins to restore clarity.",
    
            "🧠 **Reframe the Thought:** Identify the specific thought that triggered your fear. Ask yourself, ‘Is this thought absolutely true, or is it my mind’s prediction?’ Reframing helps shift your perspective from danger to possibility, giving your mind a sense of control.",
    
             "🧠 **Ground in the Present:** Fear often pulls the mind into ‘what-if’ scenarios. Bring yourself back by describing your surroundings — what you can see, hear, and feel. This reorients your brain to safety in the present moment.",
    
             "🧠 **Challenge Catastrophic Thinking:** Notice when your mind jumps to the worst-case scenario. Gently counter it with balanced thoughts such as, ‘I may not know what will happen, but I can handle it.’ This reinforces psychological resilience.",
    
        ],
        'Physical': [
            "💪 **5-4-3-2-1 Grounding:** Name 5 things you see, 4 you feel, 3 you hear, 2 you smell, 1 you taste.",
            "💨 **Regulate Your Breathing:** When fear arises, your body shifts into a stress state. Inhale slowly through your nose for four seconds, hold for two, and exhale gently through your mouth for six. This simple rhythm signals your nervous system that you are safe.",
    
            "🚶 **Engage in Gentle Movement:** Light physical activity — such as a short walk, stretching, or softly shaking out your hands — helps your body release the tension that accumulates during fear. Movement allows the stress hormones to settle naturally.",
    
             "💧 **Perform a Body Check-In:** Notice areas where your body feels tense — the shoulders, neck, or jaw are common. Consciously relax those muscles. Remind yourself that your body no longer needs to stay in 'defense mode.'",
    
            "🌿 **Use a Temperature Reset:** Applying cool water to your face or holding something cold activates the vagus nerve, which helps the body transition from a state of alertness to calm. It’s a quick and effective way to ground yourself in the present.",
    
            "🧍 **Practice a Body Awareness Scan:** Close your eyes and bring attention to where fear feels strongest — maybe your chest or stomach. Breathe slowly into that area, letting each breath ease the tension and remind your body that you are in control."
        ],
        'Spiritual': [
            "✨ **Trust and Courage:** Connect with an internal sense of strength or faith that can guide you through uncertainty."

            "🙏 **Release Fear Through Prayer:** Take a quiet moment to speak to God about what frightens you. You don’t need the perfect words — honesty itself invites peace. *'Cast all your anxiety on Him because He cares for you.' — 1 Peter 5:7*",
    
            "📖 **Meditate on God’s Protection:** Reflect on verses that remind you of divine safety. Repeat them slowly as affirmations of peace. *'Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil, for You are with me.' — Psalm 23:4*",
    
            "🌅 **Practice Faith-Based Visualization:** Picture yourself surrounded by God’s light and protection. Let that image replace the fearful thought. *'The Lord is my light and my salvation—whom shall I fear?' — Psalm 27:1*",

                    "🧠 **Acknowledge the Feeling Without Judgment:** When disgust appears, notice it and name it gently — ‘I feel disgusted right now.’ Recognizing the emotion helps your brain shift from reaction to reflection.",
    
                    "🧠 **Explore the Source:** Ask yourself, ‘What exactly triggered this feeling?’ Disgust often signals a boundary being crossed — physical, moral, or emotional. Understanding its origin turns it into useful information rather than rejection.",
    
    "🧠 **Reframe the Perception:** Instead of focusing on what repulses you, consider the broader picture — ‘Is there something to learn or forgive here?’ <br>This perspective can soften the harshness of the emotion.",
    
    "🧠 **Practice Cognitive Neutralization:** Visualize the situation becoming less vivid or intense. This helps your brain reduce overactivation in the areas linked to disgust.",
    
    "🧠 **Redirect Focus Toward Compassion:** When disgust is directed at people or situations, pause and ask, ‘How can I respond with empathy instead of avoidance?’ Compassion restores emotional balance and perspective."

                    "💪 **Change Environment:** Step away, open a window, or engage a pleasant sensory input to reset your senses."

                    "🚶 **Release the Tension Physically:** Walk, stretch, or open your posture. Physical movement helps discharge the stress energy associated with disgust.",
    
                    "💧 **Rinse or Wash as Symbolic Renewal:** If the feeling is strong, wash your hands or face mindfully — not as avoidance, but as a physical reminder of cleansing and release.",
    
                    "😌 **Relax Facial Muscles:** Disgust often shows through facial contraction. Soften your face and jaw as you exhale slowly. This signals your nervous system to relax.",
    
                    "🌿 **Ground Yourself Through Sensory Reset:** Smell something pleasant, touch a familiar texture, or focus on a neutral sound. Positive sensory input retrains your body’s emotional state."

            "🌅 **Meditate on God’s Acceptance:** When disgust is self-directed, remind yourself that God’s love is unconditional. *'Nothing can separate us from the love of God that is in Christ Jesus our Lord.' — Romans 8:38-39*",
